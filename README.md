## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage a Recurrent Neural Network for the detection of positive trends within intraday stock data. The model's input is characterized by a 20-minute range, while the subsequent trend is identified through a simple linear regression. 

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
  
### Libraries  Used
* Numpy
* PyTorch
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

## Original Data
Data was collected using [polygon.io](https://polygon.io/), and it consists of 1-minute timespan data, that includes Datetime, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, as well as Volume weighted Average Price(VW)	and number of transactions N.
